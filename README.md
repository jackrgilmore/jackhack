PRANK PROJECT: An annoying little script to use when your friend left their computer open. This program creates 100 spam.txt files in the desktop of the computer it runs on. It's really easy to use! Just download to the computer you want it run on and open the executable. 

**Operating System**
Currently, this application is only available on mac_OS. 

**Pro Tip**
If you receive the apple notification "from unidentified developer", right click on the executable and click open. Should run normally.

**Upcoming Changes**
- cross-compatibility (most likely will be made available for linux first, then windows).
- levels! Different versions for the reaction you want to produce! annoyed, irritated, pissed, seething (forever loop of file creation that crashes the computer)
